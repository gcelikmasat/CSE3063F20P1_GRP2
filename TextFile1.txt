Labeling Mechanism ? 
Configuration file? -> user bilgileri 

Again, one user will label an instance, and after that another user will take turn and 
label an instance. A user will label all the instances in the input dataset one by one. I need to see 
they are labeling instances one by one from your execution trace on command line window and also from the 
log file which will be open during your demo. The users will take turn. After one user labels an instance you 
must to switch to another user. Of course all these can be done by loops. You need to loop through instances and 
you need to loop through users. Keep it simple!

 your users are random bots which will select a label randomly


  Box(Box ob) 
    { 
        width = ob.width; 
        height = ob.height; 
        depth = ob.depth; 
    } 

Configuration file:
first line input file name/names ?
then user info ?
